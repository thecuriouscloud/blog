They are pre-configured virtual machines that contain the operating system, application server, and applications needed to run an instance on AWS. They are used to quickly launch instances in the cloud with specific configurations and software. AMIs allow for consistency, scalability, and easy replication of environments. Essentially, they act as templates for EC2 instances.</p>","tags":["EC2"]},{"location":"ami-ing-for-trust-controlling-your-trusted-providers-in-aws/#why-is-important-to-control-them","title":"Why is important to control them?","text":"<p>Using public/community AMIs may introduce vulnerabilities or malicious software that may compromise your infrastructure. AWS warns about the use of these types of AMIs in their docs:</p> <p>You use a shared AMI at your own risk. Amazon can't vouch for the integrity or security of AMIs shared by other Amazon EC2 users. Therefore, you should treat shared AMIs as you would any foreign code that you might consider deploying in your own data center, and perform the appropriate due diligence. We recommend that you get an AMI from a trusted source, such as a verified provider.</p> <p>So, what can we do to prevent their use? The answer my friend is Allowed AMIs,</p>","tags":["EC2"]},{"location":"ami-ing-for-trust-controlling-your-trusted-providers-in-aws/#allowed-amis-feature","title":"Allowed AMIs feature","text":"<p>Allowed AMIs is a new account-wide setting introduced in December 2024 that enables organizations to limit which AMIs can be discovered and used within their AWS accounts. By default, this setting is disabled in all AWS accounts.  </p> <p>Note</p> <p>Before we move any further, I'd like to highlight that this feature only restricts AMIs at the provider level (i.e. if an image comes from Amazon, from the marketplace or from another AWS account) It cannot restrict specific AMIs by ID.</p> <p>Enabling this feature is pretty straightforward:</p> <ol> <li>Navigate to the EC2 service</li> <li>Choose Dashboard</li> <li>Click on Allowed AMIs</li> <li>Configure it!</li> </ol> <p>It's worth noting that this feature is regional, so you will need to configure it in every AWS region you use. If you have a handful of AWS accounts and only operate in a few regions, you probably can simply use the Web UI as it would be a one-off configuration. </p> <p>However, maintaining this can be hard, especially when the AWS organization grows so we would need an alternative to ClickOps. The alternative could be some sort of automation via the AWS CLI, but even when the CLI is used, it doesn't scale well in large AWS organizations with hundreds or even thousands of accounts, so we need a better solution. </p>","tags":["EC2"]},{"location":"ami-ing-for-trust-controlling-your-trusted-providers-in-aws/#declarative-policies-for-the-win","title":"Declarative Policies for the win","text":"<p>Alongside the Allowed AMIs feature, AWS announced a new type of organization policy that allows organizations to define and enforce standardized configurations for AWS services across multiple accounts: Declarative Policies.</p> <p>This policy allows organizations to enforce consistent configurations across accounts and across regions, thus simplifying security governance. </p> <p>You can configure the policy in three modes:</p> <ul> <li><code>Enabled</code></li> </ul> <p>The policy is in effect and as such, users will only be able to see and use AMIs coming from the providers you allowed.</p> <ul> <li><code>Disabled</code></li> </ul> <p>Policy is not enforced so it behaves as if the policy wasn't there.</p> <ul> <li><code>Audit Mode</code></li> </ul> <p>Policy is in monitoring mode.

However, digging into the PRs, I found out that it's only a documentation issue, they are indeed supported. So, how do we use it?</p> <p>Firstly, we need to define the Declarative Policy, and for that, we create a json file. Let's call it <code>my_ami_policy.json</code></p> <pre><code>{\n    \"ec2_attributes\": {\n        \"allowed_images_settings\": {\n            \"state\": {\n                \"@@assign\": \"enabled\"\n            },\n            \"image_criteria\": {\n                \"criteria_1\": {\n                    \"allowed_image_providers\": {\n                        \"AWS Account ID\",\n                        \"amazon\",\n                        \"aws-marketplace\",\n                        \"aws-backup-vault\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Secondly, we then need to create the actual Declarative Policy resource in Terraform:</p> <pre><code>resource \"aws_organizations_policy\" \"example\" {\n  name    = \"example\"\n  content = file(\"${path.module}/path/to/your/my_ami_policy.json\")\n  type = \"DECLARATIVE_POLICY_EC2\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The last thing to do is to attach it to either root, an OU, or an AWS account.</p> <pre><code>resource \"aws_organizations_policy_attachment\" \"custom_scp_policy_attachment\" {\n  policy_id = aws_organizations_policy.example.id\n  target_id = \"Account or OU ID\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>And just as simple as that, you can implement an additional layer of defense to only use images from trusted sources.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>A side benefit of using declarative policies is that the Allowed AMI setting cannot be overridden in member accounts, eliminating the need to manage user permissions related to this setting. </p> <p>Thanks for reading!</p>","tags":["EC2"]},{"location":"archive/2025/","title":"2025","text":""},{"location":"category/aws/","title":"AWS","text":""},{"location":"category/security/","title":"Security","text":""}]}
